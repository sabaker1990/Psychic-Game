Start Game when Browers Loads
User Selects Character by pressing a character key on keyboard
Selected charcter displays on browser within element line "Your Gusess so far:"
Number of "Guesses Left" decrease by -1
Computer Selects a random Charcter
Compare User Character and Comupter Random Character
If both ===, then record Win (++) on element line "Wins: + number" AND
    reset Guesses Left to max number 10 and repeat function line 1 thru 6.
Else repeat function lines 2 through 6 until "TRUE" is meet
If number of Guesses Left = 0, then then record Loss (++) on element line "Losses: + number" AND reset Guesses = 9 (Max Guesses).
Function will repeat for new game.

Notes:  Wins & Loses will contniue to increase without a max.

var computerLetterArray = [A-Z]
var computerGuesses = Math.floor(Math.Random) * computerLetterArray.length
var guessesLeft = 9
var wins = 0
var losses = 0

document.onkey = function(event) {
    var key = .event.key;
}

var userGuessesArray =[]
    Where user guesses are stored in Javascript Memory - similiar to the car milieage class activity.

function would have guessesLeft -- negative incremental somewhere
function would have wins ++ around the IF TRUE statement
function would have losses ++ around the guessesLeft = 0 statement
